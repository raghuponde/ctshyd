Question 1
------------

James is working on a password generation feature for user accounts in an application.
He wants a program that takes the user's name, regardless of its case and generates
a password based on specific criteria. Help James to develop a C# program 
that takes the user's name as input, handles case-insensitivity, 
and generates a password according to the outlined conditions.



Constraints:

The password generation criteria are as follows:
The password must be at least 8 characters long.
When the user's name length is less than 8 characters, perform the following steps:
Convert the first letter of the user's name to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
Add the special character "@" after the name.
Append digits at the end, add digits starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 until the length reaches at least 8 characters.
When the user's name is already 8 characters or more, display a message "Name must be less "
 

Note:

Do not edit the existing code template.
In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.
Implement the business requirements within the main method. Please do not change the class name.
Do not use Environment.Exit() to terminate the program.
 

Sample Input / Output 2

Enter user name

bob

 

Generated Password: Bob@1234

 

Sample Input / Output 2

Enter user name

Charlotte

 

Name must be less than 8 characters

CargoDock class needs to inherit from the abstract DockingSystem class (DockingSystem class is already provided in the code template)

You are provided with the main method in the Program class as code template, and it is excluded from evaluation.



Note:


-         Edit only the CargoDock class to implement the business requirements.

-         Keep all methods public.

-         Do not use Environment.Exit() to terminate the program.

-         Do not change the given code template.

-         In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user and the rest of the text represents the output.

Question 5 
----------
Alex is organizing a gaming tournament, and he wants a program to find the first round where a player qualifies based on their performance. Write a C# program to assist Alex in creating a first qualifying round finder.

For example, Consider a gaming tournament with 5 rounds where a player scores 8, 5, 12, 7, and 13 points in each respective round. In this scenario, the first qualifying 
round is determined to be Round 3 because 12 is greater than any previous round's points (8, 5).



Constraints:

The player qualifies for the next round, display "Congratulations! The player has qualified for the next round with a first maximum point of <axPoint> in Round <qualifyingRound>".
When no qualifying round is found, the program will display the message "No qualifying round found".
 

Note:

Do not edit the existing code template.
In the Sample Input / Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user, and the rest of the text represents the output.
Implement the business requirements within the main method. Please do not change the class name.
Do not use Environment.Exit() to terminate the program.
